<h1>Root or user prompt</h1>
<p>When you log in you'll run commands as a user or root. You can tell by the
symbol after the username. For example:</p>
<h2>Root prompt</h2>
<p>The root user will always have a # sign after its name (which is also
root). This example also assumes you're logged into a server, not your local
computer:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">
<span class="server">root@server:~#</span>
</pre>
</div>
<span class="note">Note that the ~ symbol means you're in that user's home
directory.</span>

<h2>User prompt</h2>
<p>If you're logged in as a user the prompt ends with a $ sign.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">
<span class="server">user@server:~$</span>
</pre>
</div>
<span class="note">Note that the ~ symbol means you're in that user's home
directory.</span>
